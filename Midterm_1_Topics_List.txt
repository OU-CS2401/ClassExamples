Midterm 1 Topics List 

*** All material covered so far this semester is fair game. ***

1. Operator Overloading
    * Member, Non-Member, Friend
    * Where do the declarations go?
    * How many arguments does each take?
    * How is private data accessed differently for each method?
    * Do the arguments on either side of the operator need to be the same type?
2. Debugging
    * GDB commands
    * How do you compile a program for debugging?
    * What kinds of errors does the debugger help you find?
3. Container classes
    * What is a container class?
    * What types of containers have we covered?
4. Searching and Sorting
    * Linear search 
    * Bubble sort 
    * Selection sort 
    * Insertion sort 
    * Big O notation
        * What does Big O represent? That is, what does it tell us about an algorithm?
        * What is the Big O for the search/sort algorithms we covered in class?
5. Dynamic Memory
    * pointers 
    * new 
    * delete 
6. Dynamic Arrays
    * allocating
    * deallocating
    * resizing
    * using in a container 
        * The Big 3
7. Linked Lists
    * Node structure
    * How is data organized?
    * How are nodes kept in sequence?
    * Advantages over dynamic arrays
        * Easier to insert, remove while maintaining order
        * Never have to resize
        * Can take advantage of smaller pieces of available memory - can store more data overall
    * Disadvantages
        * Loss of random access to elements
        * Have to follow pointers
        * Total number of bytes used is greater for the same number of items
    * Special cases to consider when adding / removing nodes
